/**
 * Fetches questions for a worksheet while intelligently falling back to the network only
 * when the Apollo cache is incomplete.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 * 1. Run the query with the default `cache-first` policy (cheap â€‘ uses cache when possible).
 * 2. Check how many questions came back. If that count equals `expectedNumQuestions`, the
 *    cache already holds everything we need, so we return the result immediately.
 * 3. If the cache is missing any of the expected questions, immediately re-execute the
 *    same query with `fetchPolicy: "network-only"` to bypass the cache and fetch a fresh,
 *    complete data set.
 *
 * In short, this helper lets callers "attempt cache, guarantee completeness" without having
 * to decide between `cache-first` and `network-only` every time they query for a list of
 * questions.
